# Basic-Telephone-Directory

This Application uses the concept of Isolated Scope of Angular Directive. So all the different types of isolated scopes are used  i.e. @, =, &.
<br/>1. "@" scope is used here for the Telephone Numbers,
<br/>2. "=" scope is used here for the Networks and 
<br/>3. "&" scope is used here for Making a Call on dialed Number.
<br/><br/>So this Application clears understanding on Isolate Scopes. Feel free to fork and clear this concept.

##Tip
For Guys new in Angular, Let me explain in short:<br/>
Instead of using link function in Angular Directives, a better way of doing is using concept of Isolated Scopes. Now there are basically three different types of Isolated Scope.<br/>
- @ Scope: It tells the directive that the value passed into the new property will be accessed as a String.<br/>
- = Scope: It tells the directive that the object passed into the new property should be two-way binding. If the outside property value changes, then the directive's customer property should be automatically updated.<br/>
- & Scope: It allows you to invoke an expression, call an expression on parent scope or evaluate the expression.<br/>
